Description: 
    The project proposes an idea to enable user to have a personalised adaptive user interface for an augmented reality application. With AR becoming the next generation technology it is necessary for making it easy to understand and use. The project aims to revolutionize the users interaction with AR content. The primary goal of is to increase user engagement, seamless flow through the UI, scalable to other AR applications. The data collected will range from personal information to user interaction logs. The data collected will be identification of navigation pattern, button clicks, swipes, taps and user preference for getting a personalized view of the usage by the users. The data can be a identifier for type of button clicked, number of times it wax clicked, etc. It can be used to know how often the user navigates from oone link to other? Which area has the highest taps/swipes? The highest/lowest used buttons?  

Intellectual Merit: 
    The project has the potential to be used as a general technique or method to be followed while building AR applications to make them more seamless or adaptable. The data collected will be used in real-time analysis for each individual user and can largely exploit cloud computing as a regular practice. 

Data Sourcing: 
    The data can be retrieved by using a mock AR application to collect and log user data. This would involve user testing with prototyping. The data for user interaction with a system available online at https://datarade.ai/data-products/mfour-s-1st-party-app-web-venue-data-2m-consumers-2-5b-mfour can also be used.
    
Background Knowledge: 
    Augmented Reality works as a bridge between the real world and digital world. AR enhances the real world by superimposing digital data like 2d/3d models and interactive elements. It provides a more interactive and dynamic experience to the user interface. AR technology is currently used widely in various fields of gaming, education and healthcare. Popular application like Snapchat uses AR for various interactive filters.
    The study validates the benefits of Adaptive User Interface (AUIs), they increase the user-machine interactivity and adaptablity [1]. The review of various research papers about AUIs suggest that there is still scope to explore the fields to apply it. AR applications lack ease of use as various users find it difficult to navigate. The use AUIs can solve this problem efficiently. A personalised AUI will makes the application adaptible and fun to use as well. This will require large user data and analysis to identify their preferrences. A case study done in the form of a mobile app called APA (Assistant Personal App), whose adaptability features have been tested in several scenarios [4].
