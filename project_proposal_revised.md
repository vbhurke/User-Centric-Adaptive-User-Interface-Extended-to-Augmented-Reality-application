Description: 
    The project proposes an idea to enable user to have a personalised adaptive user interface which can be extended to augmented reality application. With AR becoming the next generation technology it is necessary for making it easy to understand and use. The project aims to revolutionize the users interaction with webpages and AR content. The primary goal of is to increase user engagement, seamless flow through the UI, scalable to other web and AR applications. The data collected will range from personal information to user interaction logs. The data collected will be identification of navigation pattern, button clicks, swipes, taps and user preference for getting a personalized view of the usage by the users. The data can be a identifier for type of button clicked, number of times it was clicked, etc. It can be used to know how often the user navigates from oone link to other? Which area has the highest taps/swipes? The highest/lowest used buttons?  

Intellectual Merit: 
    The project has the potential to be used as a general technique or method to be followed while building web or AR applications to make them more seamless or adaptable. The data collected will be used in real-time analysis for user and can largely exploit cloud computing as a regular practice for individual user interface. It can improve the navigation, advertising and ways to get new users attracted to use the website.

Data Sourcing:

    The dataset is updated everyday and may change in MD5 value. The data can also be collected via an API call.

Background Knowledge: 
    In an Adaptive User Interface, it is important to identify the user data and impact of features on users. In user interface the user should be easily be able to traverse through the webpages and links and come across the required or desired information. In order to make this easy it is important to take into consideration of relation of sites and how users tend to interact with them. You will notice the use of terms like 'button clicks' in the initial project document, the button clicks are linked to the links and similar to traversing to a webpage. In User Experience it is necessary to identify how the user is interacting with the product and build on the consensus of the data.
    The User Experience focuses on various factors of usability, interaction design, structure, findability and accessibility. The data for such users on a webpage can be mapped to an AR webpage which will have similar structure. Augmented application of such 2D webpages will have similar traversal and interactions, thus the data can be improvised to implement in an AR version of the application. 
    Popular application like Snapchat uses AR for various interactive filters. The study validates the benefits of Adaptive User Interface (AUIs), they increase the user-machine interactivity and adaptability [1]. An AUI will make the application adaptable and fun to use as well. A case study done in the form of a mobile app called APA (Assistant Personal App), whose adaptability features have been tested in several scenarios [4].     
    Note :  The AUI technique can be used for AR applications as understood from [2] and [3].

Research Objectives:
1) One that captures your exploratory visualization work.
RO1_1: To describe the trends within the page paths (url) for a webpage analytics data.
RO1_2: To find the trend on which webpage new users are being attracted to in the unique views and average time on webpage.

2) One that captures your application of a machine learning technique in classification or regression to a problem.
RO2_1: To predict the class of webpage based on page views and entrances to classify the webpage. (classification)
RO2_2: To predict the exit rate on webpages using the exit rate and bounce on webpage analytics data. (regression)

3) One that captures the defensibility of the RO2 model.
RO3_1: To defend the model for performing the prediction of RO2_1.
RO3_2: To defend the model for performing the prediction of RO2_2.

4) One that captures ability of your model to provide insight into the relationships within your data.
RO4_1: To evaluate the relationships implied by RO2_1.
RO4_2: To evaluate the prediction of future top webpages in RO2_2.
